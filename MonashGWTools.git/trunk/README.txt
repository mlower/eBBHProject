Suggestions

1. Let's put a list of functions at the beginning of each .py file like a table
of contents.  Let's put the functions in alphabetical order.

2. The name tools.py is not very descriptive since these are all tools.

3. Let's start an overleaf document to list the different .py functions and
to describe what's inside each one (in broad terms).


Action Items

1. Fix freq_damping to avoid hard-coded table.
